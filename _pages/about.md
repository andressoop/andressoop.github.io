I am a first-year PhD student in Ecological Economics at the University of Tartu, Faculty of Social Sciences, School of Economics and Business Administration. My research explores opportunities and limits to [degrowth](https://degrowth.info/degrowth) society within the European Union. 

In my previous life, I have mostly worked in web development and volunteered extensively in different NGOs and student organisations related to youth work. For fun, I like to travel, read books, listen to podcasts and sometimes (read often) play computer games.
